- **Day 7:** Fish (optional, not more than once/week)

### Why Rotate?
- Different amino acid profiles

- Prevents food sensitivities
- Ensures nutritional diversity
- Mimics natural prey variety

### Minimum Rotation:
- At least 2-3 different proteins per week
- Don't feed single protein for more than 2 weeks
- Introduce new proteins gradually (mix with familiar ones)

## Special Considerations

### Duck:
- ✅ Fattier than chicken (good for thin cats)
- ✅ Readily available in HK
- ⚠️ Remove excess fat if cat has pancreatitis history
- ⚠️ Duck bones are softer, adjust ratios carefully

### Venison:
- ✅ Excellent for food allergies/sensitivities
- ✅ Very lean (good for overweight cats)
- ⚠️ More expensive, use strategically
- ⚠️ May need to add fat source if too lean
- 💡 Great for elimination diets

### Rotation Strategy:
- Start with common proteins (chicken, beef)
- Introduce duck after 2-3 weeks
- Add venison if needed for sensitivities
- Keep rabbit and fish in rotation
- Monitor stool quality with each new protein
